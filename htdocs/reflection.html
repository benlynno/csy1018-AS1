            In the beginning there was the WEB, and “man”(me) knew absolutely nothing about the WEB, let alone experience in creating
            websites. But thanks to Liz Coulter-Smith (Module Leader) and Andrew Dean (Module Tutor), ‘man’ is able to understand
            what it takes to build a website. It’s no secret that web design is a fast-growing industry. Almost every type
            of business is in need of a quality website and there are many opportunities on a large scale from freelancers
            down to developing small-business websites from home.
            <br>
            <br> Before the start of this course, I knew nothing about HTML,CSS,Syntax,htdocs, and many more. Especially, coming
            from a background that had nothing to do the web. Though, it was challenging and it is still, I am enjoying the
            experience that comes with it. With the available 24-hour support for students, it is really helpful whenever
            you are stuck or struggling. Through this support, I have been able to grasp the fundamentals of web designing
            and developing. As it is said, journey of a thousand miles, begins with a step, everybody starts from somewhere
            in life or everything, and there’s no better time than present to begin web design education. I know, no one
            you can become a professional web designer overnight. It takes years to reach an expert level in any aspect of
            the field.
            <br>
            <br> In a sober reflection, I think I have come a long way in this programme and getting myself up to speed can be
            a daunting task but it is doable.
